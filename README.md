# GeneticAlgo

This repository contains:
 
1. A basic genetic algorithm implementation. It aims to reconstruct a specific pattern based on a random population of individuals.
2. A knapsack functionality based on genetic evolution too. The goal is to propose an optimal solution in order to pack the most important objects in a bag taking into account its weight constraint.

The robustness and functionalities will be improved soon.. stay stuned!
